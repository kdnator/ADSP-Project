# Speech-Denoising
Contains all MATLAB programs related to my undergraduate thesis. Paliwal and Basu were the first to apply the Kalman filter in speech denoising. We extend their method by tuning the Kalman filter's measurement noise covariance, R, and the process noise covariance, Q. The process noise covariance is chosen such that trade-off is achieved between <it>sensitivity</it> and <it>robustness</it>.
